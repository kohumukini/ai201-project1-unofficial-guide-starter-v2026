"""
Stage 2 of the pipeline: splitting documents into chunks.

⚠️ THIS IS THE FILE YOU CHANGE IN MILESTONE 3.

`split_documents` below is deliberately plain. It cuts every document into
fixed-size pieces with a fixed overlap and pays no attention to where sentences
or paragraphs end. It works, and it is not good.

On a corpus of short posts it may not cut anything at all: `campus_life` comes
out as 88 documents and 88 chunks, because almost nothing in it reaches 800
characters. That is the baseline, not a bug — Milestone 3 is where you decide
whether one post should stay one chunk.

Your job in Milestone 3 is to replace the *body* of `split_documents` with a
strategy that fits the documents you actually read in Milestone 1. Keep the
name and the shape of what it returns — the rest of the pipeline calls it, and
your README has to name the function that produced your chunks.

If you get stuck for 30 minutes, `fallback_split` is the original. Switch back
to it, write down what you saw, and move on. That's a real observation about
your pipeline, not giving up.

    Split documents into chunks. ⚠️ REPLACE THE BODY OF THIS IN MILESTONE 3.

    Right now it just calls the fallback. That is the plain, generic behaviour
    the brief is talking about.

    When you write your own strategy, set `produced_by` to
    "chunker.py::split_documents" so your README's Sample Chunks section names
    the right function. `app.py chunks` prints that string for you.

    Things worth thinking about before you write any code:
        - Are your documents short posts or long guides?
        - Is the useful information in one sentence, or spread over a paragraph?
        - Would splitting on paragraph breaks keep more thoughts intact than
        splitting on a character count?
